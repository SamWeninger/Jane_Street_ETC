# Jane_Street_ETC
### Jane Street Electronic Trading Challenge, June 2019

#### Competition and Algorithm Description
Developed a trading algorithm to buy and sell different financial instruments (i.e. stocks, bonds, ETFs, ADRs) in order to maximize profit in a simulated market with other teams. Our team looked to find ETF Arbitrage opportunities in the simulated market and common stock / ADR pairings.

Our team placed 2nd with over 100 undergraduate and graduate student participants in the competition. One of the key advantages was that our algorithm was developed in C++, while other teams used Python. This made our algorithm faster than the other teams we traded against.

#### Team Involvement
My role in the competition was development of the trading algorithm using C++. Other members focused on the economic / trading strategy (Vedant Shah, Undergraduate at University of Toronto, and Armun Ghafari, Undergraduate at University of Toronto).
